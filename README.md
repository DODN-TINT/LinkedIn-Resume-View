== Description ==

Do you have a LinkedIn Profile? Have you ever tried to print it as a resume? Well, I tried,
but couldn't find anything that did what I wanted it to.  So I made something that did.

All the code is doing is hiding several parts of the page that shouldnâ€™t be printed, 
then restyling several other parts to make them look, and print, better.

Exact steps to customize and reproduce the Bookmark code can be found inside the JS file itself.

Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,

== Installation ==

1. Create a browser Bookmark
2. Give it a title, something like "LinkedIn Resume"
3. Copy/paste the compressed JavaScript function into the URL of the Bookmark
4. Go to your LinkedIn Profile page (I recommend using "View profile as: Connections")
5. Click the Bookmark
7. Your Profile should immediately transform into a page that looks good on the screen and prints well.
