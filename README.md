== Description ==

Do you have a LinkedIn Profile? Have you ever tried to print it as a resume? Well, I tried,
but couldn't find anything that did what I wanted it to.  So I made something that did.

All the code is doing is hiding several parts of the page that shouldnâ€™t be printed, 
then restyling several other parts to make them look, and print, better.

Exact steps to customize and reproduce the Bookmark code can be found inside the JS file itself.

Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,
